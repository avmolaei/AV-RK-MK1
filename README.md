# Another keyboard build? whyYyyYYyYYYYy????

Because I love keyboards god dang it! Also, I built a while ago a [REAL redox, by MattDB](https://github.com/mattdibi/redox-keyboard), with gateron blues. After quite a bit of use, it starts showing its age, and its shortcomings. I wanted to design my own version, and add my own shitty ideas in the mix!

## okay sure, but what's different??
To be completely honest, the way the switch grid is layout is almost identical to the redox, as I took measurements from my current redox, which I find pretty comfy. BUT LOOK IT HAS TINY WINDOWS TO SEE THE TINY ELECTRONICS!!!!!!!!
Also, It uses the  more modern low profile Kailh Choc Robins (yeah I'm a clicky guy) switches. Something that blows my mind is that the Cherry MX switch standard dates back from 1983, it's almost 40 years old.... 
Cherry switches are great, but here is the deal:

Here, a Gateron blue switch with a pretty typical keycap measures around 25mm. Twenty five god damn millimiters, and this is not even with a chassis!
If you add in the chassis of, for instance, [the AV-KO 1 MK I keyboard](https://github.com/avmolaei/AV-KO1), you have between 30 to 40mm of thiccness:

You might say to yourself that "okay sure, who cares if the keyboard is yay high or whatever? YOU CARE! having such high switches means you have to put your wrists at like a 30° angle, which puts lots of strain on them.
This is where the low profile Kailh Choc come into play: the whole keyboard build is 20mm high, which is 5mm less than just a cherry keycap+switch:
